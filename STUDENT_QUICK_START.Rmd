# Quick Start Guide for Students

## Before You Begin

‚úÖ **What you need:**
- R (version 4.0 or higher) - [Download here](https://cran.r-project.org/)
- RStudio - [Download here](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)
- ~500 MB free disk space
- 90-100 minutes of focused time

---

## Step 1: Download the Tutorial

**No git or GitHub account needed!**

1. Go to: `https://github.com/shandley/16S_tutorials`
2. Click the green **"Code"** button
3. Click **"Download ZIP"**
4. Extract the ZIP file to your computer
   - **Windows:** Right-click ‚Üí Extract All
   - **Mac:** Double-click the ZIP file

---

## Step 2: Open the Project in RStudio

1. Navigate to the extracted folder
2. **Double-click** the file: `16S_tutorials.Rproj`
   - This opens RStudio with the correct working directory
   - Do NOT open R or RStudio separately!

**‚úì You're ready when:**
- RStudio opens
- The Files pane (bottom-right) shows the tutorial files
- Console shows the project directory path

---

## Step 3: Install Required Packages (One Time Only)

In the RStudio **Console** (bottom-left), type:

```r
source("setup_packages.R")
```

Press **Enter** and wait 5-10 minutes for packages to install.

**‚úì Installation successful when you see:**
```
SUCCESS! All packages installed correctly.
You can now run the 16S tutorial.
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è If installation fails:**
- Check your internet connection
- Restart R: Session ‚Üí Restart R
- Try again: `source("setup_packages.R")`

---

## Step 4: Start the Tutorial

1. In RStudio, open: `16S_tutorial_revised.Rmd`
   - Click it in the Files pane (bottom-right)

2. **Run chunks in order:**
   - Click the green arrow (‚ñ∂) on each code chunk
   - OR: Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + Enter to run current chunk
   - Read the text between chunks!

3. **Work through in order:**
   - Part 1: Introduction
   - Part 2: Data Quality
   - Part 3: Rarefaction
   - Part 4: Alpha Diversity
   - Part 5: Beta Diversity
   - Part 6: Community Composition
   - Part 7: Differential Abundance
   - Part 8: Practice Exercises

**‚è± Expected time:** 90-100 minutes

## File Overview

**Start here:**
- `16S_tutorial_revised.Rmd` - Main tutorial (core concepts)

**After completing core tutorial:**
- `16S_tutorial_solutions.Rmd` - Solutions to practice exercises
- `16S_advanced_machine_learning.Rmd` - ML module (optional, 45-60 min)
- `16S_advanced_time_series.Rmd` - Time series module (optional, 45 min)

**Don't open these:**
- `setup_packages.R` - Already ran this
- `data/` folder - Tutorial loads these automatically
- Other `.md` files - Documentation for instructors

---

## Common Issues

**Problem: "Cannot find file"**
- **Solution:** Make sure you opened `16S_tutorials.Rproj` first!

**Problem: "Package not found"**
- **Solution:** Re-run `source("setup_packages.R")`

**Problem: Code chunks fail with errors**
- **Solution:** Restart R (Session ‚Üí Restart R) and run ALL chunks from the beginning

**Problem: Plots show "NA" for treatment**
- **Solution:** Restart R and re-run from the beginning (you have old data in memory)

**Problem: Tutorial seems broken**
- **Solution:** Download fresh copy from GitHub (you may have edited something)

---

## Tips for Success

‚úÖ **DO:**
- Run chunks in order from top to bottom
- Read the explanatory text between chunks
- Try to understand what each line of code does
- Attempt practice exercises yourself before checking solutions
- Ask questions if stuck!

‚ùå **DON'T:**
- Skip chunks or run out of order
- Edit the tutorial code (use a separate R script for experiments)
- Close RStudio without saving your work
- Panic if you get an error (restart R and try again)

---

## Getting Help

**During the tutorial:**
1. Read the error message carefully
2. Check the "Common Issues" section above
3. Restart R and re-run from the beginning
4. Ask your instructor

**After the tutorial:**
- GitHub Issues: `https://github.com/shandley/16S_tutorials/issues`
- Email your instructor

---

## What You'll Learn

By the end of the core tutorial, you'll be able to:

‚úì Assess microbiome sequencing quality
‚úì Calculate alpha diversity metrics
‚úì Perform beta diversity analysis
‚úì Visualize microbial communities
‚úì Test statistical hypotheses (PERMANOVA)
‚úì Identify differentially abundant bacteria
‚úì Connect microbiome to biological outcomes

**Advanced modules teach:**
- Machine learning for prediction
- Time series analysis
- And more!
