# 16S Tutorial Revision Summary

## Overview

I've completely redesigned your 16S tutorial from the ground up with a focus on **pedagogy**, **biological insight**, and **statistical rigor**. The new tutorial (`16S_tutorial_revised.Rmd`) transforms a technical workflow into an engaging learning experience.

---

## Major Changes

### 1. **Learning-Centered Design**

**Old Approach:**
- Jumped straight into code
- No clear learning objectives
- Minimal interpretation guidance

**New Approach:**
- **Clear learning objectives** listed up front (7 specific goals)
- **Biological question first**: "Can altering the gut microbiome with antibiotics change viral infection outcomes?"
- **Guided discovery** with "Pause and Think" questions throughout
- **Two formal checkpoints** to consolidate learning
- **Practice exercises** at the end for independent work

### 2. **Narrative Structure**

**Old:** Linear code execution (load → filter → plot)

**New:** Story-driven analysis
1. Introduction with compelling biological context
2. Data exploration (understand before analyzing)
3. Quality assessment (teach principles, not just code)
4. Alpha diversity (within-sample diversity)
5. Beta diversity (between-sample differences)
6. Community composition (who's there?)
7. Differential abundance (which specific bacteria?)
8. Synthesis (connect back to survival outcomes)

### 3. **Statistical Rigor**

#### Added Statistical Tests:
- **Kruskal-Wallis test** for alpha diversity differences
- **Pairwise Wilcoxon tests** with Bonferroni correction
- **PERMANOVA** for beta diversity (treatment and timepoint effects)
- **DESeq2** for differential abundance testing

**Why this matters:** Students learn that visualization alone isn't enough – you need statistics to make claims!

### 4. **Differential Abundance Analysis** (Your Request!)

**New Section (Part 6):**
- Uses **DESeq2** (industry standard for count data)
- Compares Vehicle vs Amp+Metro at Day 7
- Includes:
  - Volcano plot showing all ASVs
  - Top 20 differentially abundant taxa
  - Boxplots showing abundance by treatment
  - Full interpretation guidance

**Educational value:** Students learn which specific bacteria are affected by antibiotics, not just phylum-level patterns.

### 5. **Fixed Critical Bugs**

- **Shannon diversity plot bug** (line 243-246 in original): Was plotting `Observed` instead of `Shannon`
- **Hardcoded sample removal**: Replaced with teachable outlier detection approach
- **Missing interpretation**: Every plot now has interpretation prompts

### 6. **Improved Code Quality**

#### Better Explanations:
```r
# OLD: No explanation
ps2.ra <- transform_sample_counts(ps2, function(OTU) OTU/sum(OTU))

# NEW: Clear explanation
# Transform to relative abundance (divide each count by sample total)
ps2_ra <- transform_sample_counts(ps2, function(x) x / sum(x))
```

#### Consistent Style:
- Used `%>%` pipes consistently
- Clear variable naming (`ps2_ra` for relative abundance)
- Comments explain WHY, not just WHAT

### 7. **Visual Improvements**

**Enhanced Plots:**
- Variance explained on ordination axes (e.g., "PC1 (45.2%)")
- Statistical annotations using `ggpubr::stat_compare_means()`
- Error bars and confidence ellipses where appropriate
- Faceted views for time series
- Color palettes optimized for colorblind accessibility
- Descriptive titles with clear subtitles

**New Visualizations:**
- Volcano plot for differential abundance
- Summary 4-panel figure synthesizing results
- Phylum dynamics over time with error bars
- Survival rate bar chart with percentages

### 8. **Biological Interpretation Throughout**

**Examples of added interpretation:**

After alpha diversity:
> "Which treatment has the lowest diversity? Does diversity change over time?"

After PERMANOVA:
> "What explains more variation: treatment or time?"

After differential abundance:
> "Which bacterial families/genera are depleted by Amp+Metro? Are any bacteria enriched by antibiotics? (These might be antibiotic-resistant!)"

### 9. **Exploration Before Filtering**

**Old:** Immediately filtered samples

**New (Part 1):**
- Examine dataset structure first
- Explore metadata (sample sizes, groups)
- Check sequencing depth across samples
- Preview taxonomic composition
- **Then** make informed filtering decisions

**Why:** Students learn to understand their data before manipulating it.

### 10. **Connecting to Survival Outcomes (Part 7)**

**New section** linking microbiome findings to biological outcomes:
- Shannon diversity vs survival status
- Survival rates by treatment
- Discussion of mechanisms (immune modulation, metabolites, etc.)
- Reference to fecal transplant experiments proving causality
